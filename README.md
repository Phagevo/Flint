# ðŸš€ __PJNAME__ : AI-powered protein receptor mutation

A computational tool designed to generate protein receptor mutants that allows enhanced binding specificity towards a target ligand, based on [PocketGen]. While generating a set of mutated receptor structures, __PJNAME__ evaluates their affinity with the ligand using [AutoDock Vina]. By default, our custom `__MODELNAME__` pre-trained model checkpoint is used for the generation. The key point is that the docking simulation was embedded as the scoring function during the learning transfer, making it the target of the gradient descent (see [Model](https://2024.igem.wiki/evry-paris-saclay/model) article on the team's wiki).

## Outputs and expected results

If executed correctly, __PJNAME__ will generate a set of unique mutated receptor proteins in PDB format, designed to maximize the binding affinity for the ligand ; and a summary file containing, for each receptor :
   - The corresponding docking score, affinity constant and rank compared to other mutants.
   - Additional information about the receptor-ligand interaction (e.g. ligand position, residues involved).
   - The sequence of mutations that leads to its creation, starting from the original receptor.

## Getting started with __PJNAME__

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Phagevo/__PJNAME__.git
cd __PJNAME__
git clone https://github.com/Phagevo/PocketGen.git
```s
Install the environment and dependencies using [conda]'s config file
```bash
conda env create -f env.yaml
conda activate __PJNAME__
```
If you intend to build environment without conda, keep in mind that installing [AutoDock Vina] from `pip` or any other package manager is deprecated. Besides, to run the project from Windows, [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71865073/unable-to-install-autodock-vina-potentially-due-to-boost) on stackoverflow might be helpful.
```yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ pocketgen # can be cloned from PocketGen repository
â”œâ”€â”€ checkpoints # folder needs to be created manually
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ __MODELNAME__.pt
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pocketgen.pt 
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ eval
â”œâ”€â”€ model
â””â”€â”€ __PJNAME__.py
```
This (above) is what should ressemble your working directory after installing __PJNAME__.

## Usage from command line
```bash
python __PJNAME__.py --receptor <receptor.pdb> --ligand <ligand.sdf> --output <output_directory>
```
- `<receptor.pdb>`: Path to the input protein receptor file in PDB format.
- `<ligand.sdf>`: Path to the input ligand file in SDF format.
- `<output_directory>`: Directory where the output mutant structures and scores will be saved.
